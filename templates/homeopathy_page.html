            Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician and chemist, discovered that very
            minute doses of natural substances could cure illnesses without toxic
            side effects.

            <p>
                The practice of Homeopathy is based upon science while its application
                is an art. Before the medicines are decided upon, their curative
                powers are discovered by testing them out on healthy human subjects
                and carefully noting emotional, mental and physical changes. This is
                termed a ‘proving’. This information constitutes the basis for ‘like
                cures like’, for a medicine’s unique symptom picture must match up
                with the individual’s unique expression of their disease, that is,
                the present and persisting symptoms of the disease.
            </p>

            <p>
                The second principle, that only ‘the minimum dose’ should be employed
                is based upon the understanding that the stimulus of the medicine
                works from within the vitality and is not imposed from the outside.
